# Better TOTD

A TOTD browser with info about your PBs and medals.

Features:

* View your medals by month, by campaign, or for all TOTDs.
* Easily and quickly play any TOTD in Solo.
* Filter TOTDs by date, medals, author, track name, TMX tags.
* Instant PB loading, after TOTDs load.
* Quick buttons for tm.io and TMX.

If a map appears to be stuck, you can trigger a reload by loading and exiting that map.

Note: Instant PB loading is experimental, please report bugs. As a backup, your PBs are loaded from the game's API, too (takes about 5 min to full load all PBs).

### TODO

- sort by # of ppl who have AT
- integration with author-tracker
- ~~filter map name~~
- ~~add sorting to TOTD table~~
- ~~styles via TMX~~

### TEST
